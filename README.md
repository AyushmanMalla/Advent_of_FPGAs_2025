# Advent of FPGA 2025

This repository contains solutions and experiments for the [Jane Street Advent of FPGA Challenge 2025](https://blog.janestreet.com/advent-of-fpga-challenge-2025/).

## Project Structure

*   **`algo_prototypes/`**: Python scripts for prototyping algorithms and pseudocode to understand the puzzles before hardware implementation.
*   **`hw_lib/`**: Reusable hardware modules implementing standard software data structures and algorithms (e.g., sorting networks, hash maps) for plug-and-play use in solutions.
*   **`tb/`**: Testbenches written in Python using [cocotb](https://www.cocotb.org/) for verification.
